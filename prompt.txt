Title:  Cafe Purr
Purpose: Non-Evil Digital Museum

Intent: An  experiential and non-evil digital museum using modern architecture and integration with chatgpt and stable-diffusion-webui

Stack: Mariadb, Laravel, Inertia, Vue 3 script setup, tailwind, pinia

Current Scope: Amibot - The Anti-Malaria Intelligence

Propsectus: Amibot was created to produce something literally as ethical as possible with my tech skills.
Funds raised (as of 5/20/23): $60 (from my seed money). She emerged from Save One Human, a non-profit I started in 2020 (github.com/silasfelinus/SaveOneHuman) but raised fees instead of funds. It is currently non-active, but to efficintly begin, I've turned to Against Malaria to handle fundraising, which gives me more time to code.

Amibot is designed to engage people in chats, and encourage social sharing and donations to the site. The organization was chosen based on a web recommendation and I'm not affiliated in any way with the funds. They track donations based on the cost of mosquito nets, so at this point, Amibot has encouraged the purchase of 30 mosquito nets for children in Africa. It's a start.

Comments: Since focusing on Amibot as my primary tech push, I've found my motivations and productivity increased. I have a clearer time talking to people about Amibot than I do about any personally financial project.

Time to get the non-profit rolling again.

[Request]
Please help me troubleshoot the initial chat back and forth, and learn how we are
keeping messages. We also have a pinia store that we would like to integrate. Can we start there?
