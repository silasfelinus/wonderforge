My dad used to say that inside of the car's air-bags was uncooked popcorn. When you wrecked the popcorn would pop and you would have a snack until help came.

When I was little, my dad told me ATMs worked by having little monkeys inside them. I believed that for years. Now I work in a bank, and wish it were true!

My dad told me the worst swear word you could possibly say was "Bostonian". It meant "someone who has no private parts." My brother and I used the word until we were teenagers and my father giggled every time we said it, right before he sent us to our rooms.

My dad told me that men worked under the streets pulling levers to change the street lights from red to green. They went to work by climbing down manholes, and then sat there all day and ate doughnuts and pulled levers.

When we'd approach exits or toll booths, my father told me the sound the car made when it went over the rumble strips was the car getting angry because I had been bad. I still sit up a little straighter when I hit a rumble strip.

When I was little, I would move my finger up and down in the air to make the car window 'magically' move up and down when I was with my dad. I always knew that he was the one doing it, but the day I said it was him he stopped. Even after, when I would lie and say I forgot, or would beg him to do it, he refused and said I was too big now. I still regret revealing I knew it was him.
